--what is docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that package an application and its dependencies, making it easy to run consistently across different computing environments (https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).
